# A collection of my work with Convolutional Neural Networks

This is a collection of my work with Convolutional Neural Networks on Kaggle Datasets. If you like my work, kindly give me a follow on my **[Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/smjishanulislam)** to see more 😁. I follow back!
## Works

### 1. Audio MNIST 🔊
  - This is my first **bronze notebook**
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sripaadsrinivasan/audio-mnist)
  - [GitHub version](./audio-mnist-with-pytorch.ipynb)
  - [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smjishanulislam/audio-mnist-with-pytorch)
  
### 2. Fashion MNIST 👗👔
  - This is the project I used an **Autoencoder** to smoothen an image before passing over to a CNN. This gave me significantly better results than the general approach
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)
  - [GitHub version](./fashion-mnist.ipynb)
  - [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smjishanulislam/fashion-mnist)
  
  
### 3. Digit MNIST 🔢
  - The dystopia of any machine learning task.
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer)
  - [GitHub version](./handwritten-digit-prediction.ipynb)
  - [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smjishanulislam/handwritten-digit-prediction)
  
### 4. Horses or Humans 🐎👨
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset)
  - [GitHub version](./horses-or-humans-in-pytorch.ipynb)
  - [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smjishanulislam/horses-or-humans-in-pytorch)


Hopefully there will be more works to come!
